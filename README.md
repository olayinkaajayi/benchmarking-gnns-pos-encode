# Numbering as A Position Encoding (NAPE) for Large-scale Graphs

<br>

## Overview

**April 8, 2024**
We designed the Numbering as A Position Encoding (NAPE) algorithm to learn the position encodings for graphs. A scaled version of the algorithm (scaled-NAPE) is also designed for large-scale graphs.

This repository has been borrowed from the Benchmarking GNN [repo](https://github.com/graphdeeplearning/benchmarking-gnns). The codes has been modified wherever deemed appropriate to add position encodings to the GNN models.



The Benchmarking GNN paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00982.pdf), and our NAPE paper is also linked here.


We specially thank the authors of [Benchmarking GNNs](https://github.com/graphdeeplearning/benchmarking-gnns) for their code, which has greatly helped with our research.
